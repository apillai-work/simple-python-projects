    "This was a very fun project to work on as I'm a huge fan of theme parks (as a kid I'd never leave until the the security gaurds had to ask me to do so). I wnated to practise if-statements as I found them a bit tricky when I first started learning python. This simple ticketing program asks the user a set of questions and determines how much they'd need to pay in order to ride the rollercoaster. "
